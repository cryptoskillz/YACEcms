# Management Portal

# Installation


## Github

If you do not have a GitHub account sign up for one [here](https://github.com/).

create a new repository using this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

Once you have done this simply add it as a remote

`git remote add <youroriginname> <githuburl>`


## Clone

clone the YACE onto your local machine.

git clone  https://github.com/cryptoskillz/YACEcms.git

then run  the following 2 commands

`npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy`

`npm install `

This will set up the YACE locally on your machine.

finally push it to the repo you set up earlier

git push github master


## Cloudflare

If you do not yet have a Cloudflare account please sign up by clicking on this [link](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up?lang=en-US).


Click Pages from the menu on the left.

Once you are there you can use the following [guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/) to connect your git and add the project you just pushed.

Select 11.ty as the framework as shown in the image below

![](https://imagedelivery.net/9dYZtR12J2uzlEZe4Joa5w/77ae9dc2-d46a-4eb6-0480-85be2803b900/public)

then add the ENV vars by going clicking on pages/buildingblocks/settings/environment variables and adding them as shown in the screenshot below

![](https://imagedelivery.net/9dYZtR12J2uzlEZe4Joa5w/ebd4fd7d-6c9b-45ce-e993-63d7ec6c6600/public)



## Wrangler

The next thing you need to do is install Wrangler.  You can find the current documentation for this [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

## D1 database
D1 is the Cloudflare database that we are using you can find out more information about it [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/).


click on workers/d1 and create a new database as shown in the image below

![](https://imagedelivery.net/9dYZtR12J2uzlEZe4Joa5w/4eec15e1-0c5c-4675-5d51-f2b384180c00/public)

then we have to add it to add a D1 database binding called DB and point it to the D1 database you created as shown below 

![](https://imagedelivery.net/9dYZtR12J2uzlEZe4Joa5w/62dc6c22-bddd-402b-8144-53e491a38c00/public)

The last thing we have to do is run the SQL file to create the tables

wrangler d1 execute DB --local  --file=./scripts/sql/schema.sql
sudo wrangler d1 execute DB --file=./scripts/sql/schema.sql



## Create environment variables 

We have to rename two files at the root of the project. These files contain the following environment variables.


_.env

_.dev.vars

to 

.env

.dev.vars

Both of these files are the same but for some reason, Cloudflare decided not to use the industry standard .env for their functions so we have to replicate it to get it working locally.  In production, we only have one set of environment variables.

ADMINURL=http://localhost:8789/

The admin URL (the root)

APIURL=http://localhost:8789/api/

The API URL

BEARERTOKEN=

The JWT token to encode with

BLOCKCHAINNETWORK=BNB

BLOCKEXPLORER=https://testnet.bscscan.com/

The chains block explorer

CANCREATEACCOUNT=0

Set if you want your users to be able to create accounts or from the admin

CLOUDFLAREURL=

The image upload URL.  Note this is paid service from Cloudflare more information can be found [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/) 

COMPLEXPASSWORD=0

Set if you want to enforce a complex password or now


EMAILAPIURL=

The email worker, you have to deploy this and it is found in the scripts/workers/email directory [here](https://github.com/OrbitLabsDAO/buildingblocksreporting/tree/master/scripts/workers/email)
